# Phoneword - 'Hello World' for Mobile Developers

**Overview:**

When someone starts to learn programming, the first chapter is always a 'Hello World', be it printing it in C/C++, displaying it in HTML web page or popup message box in desktop application. 
As this lab is aimed for mobile applications, let's build a mobile app which will make use phone functionality and make a phone call.

**Requirements:**

This lab requires Xamarin components installed on Mac or on Windows. 

**Building Phoneword App:**

Create a blank Visual Studio solution with name Phoneword. In this solution create three projects as:

- [Portable Class Library Project: Phoneword.Library](/Phoneword.Library/Readme.md) 

For this project make sure Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS is selected as targets on next screen.


- [Android 'Blank App' Project : Phoneword.Droid](/Phoneword.Droid/Readme.md)
- [iPhone 'Single View Application' Project: Phoneword.iOS](/)

Alternatively, download this repository and start modifying the existing projects.

Now, let's build these projects individually.
